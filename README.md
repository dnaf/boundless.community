Hey! In lieu of all the drama, I figured I'd write a little blurb about putting up the web server so anyone else can host it if they need to.

```
$ npm i
$ node --harmony src/run.js
```

If you want to edit configuration files, copy `config/default.json` to `config/local.json` and edit the host, port, etc as needed!
